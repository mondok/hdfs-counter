# Hadoop MapReducer for FDA Food Pyramid XML #This project is a MapReducer jar that can be used for reading the FDA Food Pyramid data.  Feel free to fork and use as you please.  It's also a good example of reading XML in Hadoop.  Thanks to [this post](http://xmlandhadoop.blogspot.com/) for the inspiration.## Usage ##`hadoop jar food-pyramid-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.edentech.foodpyramid.XmlDriver /path/to/file.xml /outputdir`For example, here's how I use it in HDFS:`hadoop jar foodpyramid.jar com.edentech.foodpyramid.XmlDriver /user/Food_Display_Table.xml /user/food`## Files ##You can grab the Food Pyramid data from data.gov at [http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mypyramid-food-raw-data-f9ed6](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mypyramid-food-raw-data-f9ed6).  I'm using the `Food_Display_Table.xml` file for this artifact.## Building from Source ##I'm using Maven, so just restore from pom.xml.
